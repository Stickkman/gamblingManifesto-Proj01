# Gambling Manifesto



## Description

This web application was created to solve the problem of wanting to place sports bets without the time necessary for researching the various things involved in those bets.  The app focuses on football for the time being and provides odds, weather conditions, various team stats, and even a wagering tips section to help out those new to sports betting.  All of this with a simple click of your mouse on the section you are interested in.  This way you have time for work and time for play.  Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too!

## Usage

Once the site loads you can click on any topics of interest relating to football betting at the top of your screen.  The current topic will be highlighted in green. The 'Wager Tips' section contains tips and instructions
for people unfamiliar with the specifics of sports betting and explains the terms/keywords involved.  The 'Team Stats' section lets you select a team from the drop down menu, then click search, and it will display the stats available for that team in a table. You can also hover over the abbreviated words in that table for a description of what it is.  Lines are numbered and separated with line dividers to keep things clean.  This section is currently still in development but will be coming soon!  For the 'Team Weather' simply enter the city where your team is playing in the green search box and click search.  The current weather conditions will be displayed below.  If there are additional alerts for this area they will be displayed with an exclamation, which makes spotting concerning conditions simple.  Finally the 'Odds' section will display the spread for upcoming games and the teams involved with those spreads.  You can quickly navigate between all the topics and the most recent weather/odds search will be maintained.  Enjoy and remember to bet responsibly.
